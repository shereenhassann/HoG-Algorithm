# HoG-Algorithm (from scratch)
HoG (Histogram of Oriented Gradient) Algorithm applied on MNIST data set for digits, using python.
Assuming the window is of the size of original image (padded) of 32x32 dimension, block size of 16x16, and cell size of 8x8
using NO built-in functions for the algorithm (other than Sobel filter). 
Then applied SVM classification to measure the accuracy of the model, and saved it.
